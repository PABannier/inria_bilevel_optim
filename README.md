# Bilevel optimization for structured sparse models

This is a working repository for my internship at INRIA with Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon and Quentin Bertrand.
You can find an implementation of MCFD SURE in the `mtl` package, as well as experiment results made on CamCan dataset
for the neuroimaging source localization inverse problem.

This internship has mainly resulted in the publication of a paper (LINK TO BE DISCLOSED) and in the implementation of SURE in `MNE` package (https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python).
