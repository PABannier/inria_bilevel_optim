# Bilevel optimization for structured sparse models

This is a working repository for my internship at INRIA with Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon and Quentin Bertrand.
You can find an implementation of MCFD SURE in the `mtl` package, as well as experiment results made on CAM-CAN dataset
for the neuroimaging source localization inverse problem.
