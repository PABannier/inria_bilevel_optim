% Also an image that is in the \texttt{prebuiltimages/} directory can also be loaded the same way:

% \begin{figure}[h] % h stands for here, ! forces even more...
% 	\centering
% 	\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{umontpellier_logo}
% 	\caption{Illustration of a prebuiltimage available.}
% 	\label{fig:umontpellier_logo}
% \end{figure}


% For displaying side by side some images one should consider the package \lstinline+subcaptions+, that can be loaded with the \LaTeX command:

% \begin{lstlisting}[language=tex]
% \usepackage{subcaption}
% \end{lstlisting}


% \begin{figure}[t] % t stands for top (up!)
%     \centering
%     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.33\textwidth}
%     	\centering
%         \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{umontpellier_logo}%
%         \caption{First example}
%         \label{subfig:pythagore}
%     \end{subfigure}
%     \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.56\textwidth}
%     	\centering
%         \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{residu_orth}%
%         \caption{Second example}
%         \label{subfig:logo}
%     \end{subfigure}
%     \caption{Exemples of side by side images}
%     \label{fig:double_example}

\subsection{MSE, SURE and F1 score baseline}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{SURE, MSE, F1 comparison}
    \label{fig:sure_mse_f1_comparison}
